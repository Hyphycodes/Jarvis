# Radar — Attention Budget & Inventory Model

## Philosophy

Jarvis is not a feed. Radar is a small, intentional tray — not a scroll.
An empty or near-empty result is always correct when nothing is strong enough.
Silence is better than filler. The system is designed around **restraint**.

## Three-Layer Inventory

| Layer | Where | Status | Size | Description |
|-------|-------|--------|------|-------------|
| **Active Radar** | `destination="radar"` `status="shown"` | shown | 7–12 | The front room. Timely, high-confidence items worth acting on this week. |
| **Holding / Later** | `destination="holding"` `status="discovered"/"shown"` | discovered | ≤30 | The back room. Strong finds that aren't urgent right now. Eligible for promotion to Radar when timing is right. |
| **Archive / History** | All destinations | saved, passed, planned, completed, expired, archived | Unbounded | Everything seen, acted on, or aged out. Searchable in `/account/history`. |

## Attention Budget Constants

All constants live in `lib/brain/constants.ts`.

| Constant | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `RADAR_IDEAL_ACTIVE_ITEM_LIMIT` | 7 | Soft target for Active Radar size |
| `RADAR_ACTIVE_ITEM_LIMIT` | 12 | Hard cap — items beyond this rotate to Holding |
| `RADAR_STALE_SHOWN_DAYS` | 14 | Days before a shown item is stale |
| `RADAR_MIN_CONFIDENCE` | 0.65 | Minimum confidence to reach Active Radar |
| `RADAR_DEFAULT_SELECTED_LIMIT` | 5 | Curator's default max selections per run |
| `RADAR_HARD_SELECTED_LIMIT` | 9 | Absolute ceiling on Curator selections |
| `RADAR_SHORTLIST_LIMIT` | 20 | Candidates passed to Curator from scorer |
| `PASSED_RESURFACE_DAYS` | 30 | Days before a passed item re-enters the pool |
| `HOLDING_ITEM_LIMIT` | 30 | Max Holding items; oldest are archived over the limit |
| `HOLDING_STALE_DAYS` | 45 | Days before a Holding item is archived |
| `RADAR_REFRESH_COOLDOWN_MINUTES` | 30 | Minimum time between Radar refresh runs |

## Category Quotas (per refresh run)

| Category | Quota |
|----------|-------|
| Dining / Restaurant | ≤ 3 |
| Events | ≤ 3 |
| Products / Style | ≤ 2 |
| North ideas | ≤ 2 |

Items exceeding a quota are rerouted to Holding instead of being rejected.

## Weekday Energy Limits (Mon–Thu)

| Tag | Weekday cap |
|-----|-------------|
| `paid` / `ticketed` | ≤ 2 on Active Radar |
| `high-effort` / `all-day` | ≤ 1 on Active Radar |

Over-quota weekday items move to Holding, not rejected.

## Source Volume Cap

Total candidates across all lanes per refresh: **60 max** (`MAX_TOTAL_SOURCE_CANDIDATES_PER_REFRESH`).

If the cap is reached mid-gather, remaining lanes are skipped cleanly.

SerpAPI (shopping) is **never** called speculatively — only on explicit product requests.  
Brave is the fallback for Tavily (never both at once in the same lane).

## Local Cultural Radar

`lib/sources/localRadar.ts` — six focused web-research query groups:

| Group | Type | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| `chicago_food` | restaurant | New openings, atmospheric dining |
| `chicago_culture` | culture | Art, galleries, exhibits |
| `chicago_music` | event | Jazz, live music, intimate venues |
| `chicago_style` | place | Menswear, boutiques, craft leather |
| `chicago_products` | product | Artisan goods, handcraft |
| `italy_travel_lifestyle` | culture | Italian craft, slow living, lifestyle |

Preferred domains are specified per group to prioritize quality sources (Eater, Monocle, etc.).
Tavily is used first; Brave is the fallback if Tavily is not configured.

**Lead extraction**: article titles and snippets are scanned for named places/businesses.
Extracted lead names are stored in `raw_payload.lead_name`. Items tagged `article-lead`
are candidates for Google Places enrichment downstream.

## Refresh Flow

```
POST /api/radar/refresh
  1. Check cooldown (30 min). Return {skipped:true} if blocked.
  2. expireOldCandidates() — time-expired events → status="expired"
  3. buildBrainContext() — founder, memory, signals, weather, inventory
  4. buildInterestGraph() — seed + memory + behavior nudges  ← Sprint 2.2
  5. runTasteStrategist() — exploration lanes (Claude)        ← Sprint 2.2
  6. buildCuriosityPlan() — lanes → typed source plan         ← Sprint 2.2
  7. gather:
     - Lane-driven: gatherFromCuriosityPlan(plan)
     - Static fallback: gatherRadarCandidates() (no lanes returned)
  8. ingestCandidates() per lane — PROTECTED_STATUSES always skipped
  9. runRadarCuration():
     a. Build pool (radar + holding, status discovered/shown)
     b. Exclude recently-passed items (from context.recentActions)
     c. shortlistByScore() — deterministic top-N by score
     d. runCurator() — Claude or deterministic fallback
     e. runCritic() — Claude or deterministic fallback
     f. enforceGates() — confidence floor, category quotas, weekday limits
     g. applyDecision() — write status/destination to DB
     h. enforceActiveRadarCap() — rotate excess shown→holding or discovered
     i. pruneStaleHolding() — archive aged Holding items
     j. logDecisionRun() → brain_decision_runs (decision + strategy snapshot)
```

See [`docs/BRAIN.md`](./BRAIN.md) for the Interest Graph + Taste Strategist + Curiosity Engine details.

## Memory of Rejections

When a user taps **Pass** on a Radar card:
- `status` → `"passed"`
- `behavior_signals` row inserted (`signal_type: "item.pass"`)
- `memoryRules` evaluates whether to propose a new memory item

Passed items respect `PASSED_RESURFACE_DAYS` (30 days). Items reset to `"discovered"`
after the window are eligible to re-enter the pool on the next refresh.

## What Jarvis Will Never Do

- Call any source API on page load or automatic schedule.
- Let Claude directly write to the database.
- Overwrite `saved`, `passed`, `planned`, `completed`, `archived`, or `opened` status.
- Run SerpAPI speculatively (shopping only on explicit product request).
- Show more than `RADAR_ACTIVE_ITEM_LIMIT` (12) items on Active Radar.
- Route an item to Active Radar with confidence < `RADAR_MIN_CONFIDENCE` (0.65).
